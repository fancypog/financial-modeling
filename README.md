# Financial Modeling

## Overview

This repository contains code for financial modeling, including:

### Calculation of high-frequency data
The code computes various volatility measures (RV, BV, TRV) at different frequencies for further analysis and modeling.


### One-step Forecast

A one-step forecast predicts the value of a time series at the next time step based on information available up to the current time step. It provides short-term predictions for financial data, helping in decision-making processes.

### Use of ARCH Model

The Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (ARCH) model is utilized for modeling volatility clustering observed in financial time series. 
The model parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood estimation, aiming to maximize the likelihood of observing the actual data given the model. 
Within the code, various parameter combinations of the ARCH model are tested, and the optimal configuration is selected for the sample data based on the least Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) method.
